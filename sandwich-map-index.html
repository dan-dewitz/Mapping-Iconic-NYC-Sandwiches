One afternoon in 2015, the chef Ned Baldwin, inspired by gooey cheese-topped French onion soup, slid some caramelized onions he had on hand for a burger in between slices of brioche and funky raclette cheese. He griddled it and served it for staff meal, where it was such a hit that he moved it to the lunch menu — with a few canny tweaks. Now the sandwich is seasoned with grainy mustard for tang and maple syrup for sweetness, and the brioche is coated in Parmesan, then crisped, frico-like, in the hot pan.

Sawako Okochi and Aaron Israel, co-chefs and co-owners of this Williamsburg restaurant, start with Wagyu beef brisket, prized for its marbled fat. They separate the flat and the deckle, which cook at different rates, and brine them with salt, brown sugar, peppercorns and coriander for about two weeks. Next rubbed with black pepper, coriander, paprika, garlic powder and ground nori, the brined meat is smoked over cherry wood, then steamed until tender. Sliced into heftier pieces than your average pastrami, the meat melts in your mouth. It’s tucked into delicate, untoasted shokupan with caraway seeds — a nod to rye — and just enough Gulden’s mustard to remind you you’re alive. ALEXA WEIBEL',

What does Dominican American barbecue look like? A take on tres golpes, maduros as a side dish and this sandwich, which is a nod to both Santo Domingo and Central Texas. (Mr. Santana was inspired to start barbecuing after watching a video about the chef Aaron Franklin.) The success lies in the combination of crispy pork, fatty brisket, pickled onions and a slather of a sauce made with Constanzera Melaza, a popular brand of Dominican molasses, for a touch of sweetness — something completely different and completely familiar.

The sandwich is a hulking specimen bursting at the seams with savory, soy-and-ginger laced beef, lettuce, rice and a gochujang-based sauce. It’s hangover food that still manages to taste fresh and bright. The flavors of bibimbap meet the anatomy of a shawarma. Most notably: It is easily two (if not three) meals in one sandwich, so make sure you leave with extra sauce. PRIYA KRISHNA',

Now, the dish formerly known as the Char Siu McRib is the char siu BK Rib, but it remains the top seller, and for good reason. It takes three days to marinate and steam the ribs, which are deboned and paired with a sesame milk bun, a smear of Chinese hot mustard, sliced onion and bread-and-butter pickles. The pork melts into the bun, and the pickles and spicy mustard bring tangy, sharp relief. PRIYA KRISHNA',

The eggs are cooked in a water bath at a low temperature, giving them their custardy texture, then sliced into planks and fried in a mixture of flour and panko. The end result is impossibly fluffy and tender yet crispy, and tastes even more luxurious in a brioche bun, embellished with a punchy yuzu kosho, pickled shallot mayo and arugula. PRIYA KRISHNA',

  'text': 'Both portions of the Rowdy stand out in a city that over the past few years has become thick with chicken sandwiches. One of this Manhattan chain’s tricks is to treat chicken like a pakora by coating it in a spiced batter dominated by chickpea flour. This produces a rugged and remarkably sturdy shell that maintains its crunch even as it laps up Rowdy Rooster’s fire-breathing chile butter. Pickled onions and mint chutney are brought to bear, too. Yogurt blended with scallions does the job often performed by mayonnaise, and does it in a more interesting way. PETE WELLS',
