    "- Bootstrap for styling, including a fixed-top navbar and a fixed-bottom footer.\n",
    "- Google Maps API for interactive map functionality.\n",
    "- Custom Markers: Each marker should use a sandwich image (with transparent background) as its icon.\n",

    "- Include jQuery and Bootstrap scripts for modal functionality.\n",

Lining up for a weekend breakfast sandwich there feels a little like being at a model casting — one wonders if the name is a play on “see and be seen” — but ordering well is a great equalizer: a fat, rich chorizo patty straight off the griddle and wobbly scrambled eggs, all piled high on an housemade roll to soak up the sausage’s spiced fat.

Their most popular sandwich is the bacon, egg and cheese on a bagel, the platonic ideal of hangover food, with an added latke layer. It may not be kosher, but it’s texturally thrilling — the bagel chewy, eggs impossibly fluffy, the latke doing that crunchy-outside, creamy-inside thing that will cure what ails you.

Made from toasted, housemade bialys and translucent slivers of wild Alaskan smoked sable, the sandwich is rounded out with scallion cream cheese for plushness, and sliced tomato for a touch of juicy sweetness. It’s an if-you-know-you-know combination that aficionados of appetizing might build for themselves from a bat mitzvah brunch platter, but it’s rarely seen preconstructed in the wild.

He later renamed the store Faicco’s Italian Specialties, and decided to introduce the mammoth sandwiches the shop is now known for. The shop’s most popular offering, the Italian hero, starts with crusty Italian bread from Mona Lisa Bakery in Dyker Heights, and is stuffed to the brim with freshly sliced prosciutto from Italy, Italian cappy-style ham from Boar’s Head, sweet soppressata, and mozzarella cheese that’s made at the shop.

The sandwich is inspired by a fried tamago that the chef Evan Hanczor first encountered in Tokyo — where he owns another restaurant. The eggs are cooked in a water bath at a low temperature, giving them their custardy texture, then sliced into planks and fried in a mixture of flour and panko. The end result is impossibly fluffy and tender yet crispy, and tastes even more luxurious in a brioche bun, embellished with a punchy yuzu kosho, pickled shallot mayo and arugula. PRIYA KRISHNA',\n",

This produces a rugged and remarkably sturdy shell that maintains its crunch even as it laps up Rowdy Rooster’s fire-breathing chile butter. Pickled onions and mint chutney are brought to bear, too. Yogurt blended with scallions does the job often performed by mayonnaise, and does it in a more interesting way. PETE WELLS',\n",

Lining up for a weekend breakfast sandwich there feels a little like being at a model casting — one wonders if the name is a play on “see and be seen” — but ordering well is a great equalizer: a fat, rich chorizo patty straight off the griddle and wobbly scrambled eggs, all piled high on an housemade roll to soak up the sausage’s spiced fat.

Their most popular sandwich is the bacon, egg and cheese on a bagel, the platonic ideal of hangover food, with an added latke layer.

(That’s how he was discovered by the Staten Island Advance’s food editor, Pamela Silvestri.) Like so many competitive cooks before him, Mr. Valois briefly went into barbecue; but he’s found much more satisfaction in this tiny sandwich shop, where one day there might be housemade pastrami on the menu and hand-rolled meatballs the next.

They’ve since moved the soba restaurant down the street and opened Cocoron Market in the original space on the Lower East Side, where they’re now serving bento boxes, ramen and stellar Japanese sandwiches. There aren’t a thousand layers of fried pork in their “mille-feuille” pork katsu sando, only six, but you wouldn’t want any more. Rich with Japanese mayo and katsu sauce that seeps into fluffy white bread, it’s a delight to dig into on a bar stool, or hunched over standing outside on the Delancey Street sidewalk.

Now, the dish formerly known as the Char Siu McRib is the char siu BK Rib, but it remains the top seller, and for good reason. It takes three days to marinate and steam the ribs, which are deboned and paired with a sesame milk bun, a smear of Chinese hot mustard, sliced onion and bread-and-butter pickles. The pork melts into the bun, and the pickles and spicy mustard bring tangy, sharp relief. PRIYA KRISHNA',\n",

The eggs are cooked in a water bath at a low temperature, giving them their custardy texture, then sliced into planks and fried in a mixture of flour and panko.

One of this Manhattan chain’s tricks is to treat chicken like a pakora by coating it in a spiced batter dominated by chickpea flour. This produces a rugged and remarkably sturdy shell that maintains its crunch even as it laps up Rowdy Rooster’s fire-breathing chile butter. Pickled onions and mint chutney are brought to bear, too. Yogurt blended with scallions does the job often performed by mayonnaise, and does it in a more interesting way. PETE WELLS',\n",
